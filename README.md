# Documentation
                                                                                      
## Purpose
This repository intends to capture the things needed by the Reading Robockets group.  

## Working with the documentation
Documentation is captured in a language called Markdown, which is described here: 
[Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
The important things to note are [Headings](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings),
[Links](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links), and
[Relative Links](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#relative-links).

## Working with Github
This repository is public to the world.  To be able to create, edit, or remove items in the repo,
you need to create a Github account and request to be added to the Robockets organization in Github.
There are many admins in the programming group, so ask in the #programmers Slack channel to be added.
Many people use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) as a UI for cloning, committing, and
pushing changes.  This [How to Use Github Desktop Guide](https://www.simplilearn.com/how-to-use-github-desktop-tutorial-article#github_desktop_tutorial_how_do_you_use_github_desktop)
can help you get started.  As someone who simply wants to contribute to documentation, you need to
* clone the https://github.com/Team4761/Documentation repository
* edit files with whatever editor you wish
* commit and push the changes using the guide above (and only that section)

What about branching and pull requests and other things?  Although these are great tools for advanced
users and collaboration, we suggest keeping it simple for most users.
